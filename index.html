            <h2>Getting started with Mailchimp</h2>
            <p>After going through the basics and making an account on Mailchimp, I went straight to making the survey. After the survey was created, I created the mail and sent it to all my contacts.</p>
            <p>The following screenshot was taken after i added all the contacts:</p>

            <p>Next up was checking how many people clicked on my mail, and used the call to action. The following picture shows the statistics right after the mail was created:</p>

            <p>This is the result after a couple of days:</p>

            <p>In general I experienced little to no issues in setting up Mailchimp, it was pretty intuitive. Adding all the contacts was easy aswell since the list of students we needed to add was already provided for (thanks for that).</p>

            <h2>Setting up the mail & survey</h2>
            <p>The main goal for my mail was to get people to fill in the survey. The goal for the survey was to gain insight on what people thought about my portfolio so that I knew what to change, so that was also indirectly the goal of the mail.</p>
            <p>The picture below contains the mail that I sent:</p>

            <p>As you can see, the main focus of the mail is the call to action. The picture shows a preview of the website so people can get a general idea of what they will see when they click on my portfolio.</p>
