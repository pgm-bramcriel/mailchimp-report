            <h2>Getting started with Mailchimp</h2>
            <p>After going through the basics and <span>making an account on Mailchimp</span>, I went straight to making the survey. After the survey was created, I created the mail and <span>sent it to all my contacts.</span></p>
            <p class="p-bold">The following screenshot was taken after i added all the contacts:</p>
            <img src="./images/audience.png">
            <p>Next up was checking how many people <span>clicked on my mail</span>, and used the <span>call to action</span>. The following picture shows the statistics right after the mail was created:</p>

            <p>This is the result after a <span>couple of days:</span></p>
            <img src="./images/mailchim-after.png">
            <p>In general I experienced <span>little to no issues in setting up Mailchimp</span>, it was pretty <span>intuitive</span>. Adding all the contacts was easy aswell since the list of students we needed to add was already provided for (thanks for that).</p>

            <h2>Setting up the mail & survey</h2>
            <p>The main <span>goal</span> for my mail was to get people to <span>fill in the survey</span>. The goal for the survey was to gain <span>insight on what people thought about my portfolio</span> so that I knew what to change, so that was also indirectly the goal of the mail.</p>
            <p class="p-bold">The picture below contains the mail that I sent:</p>
            <img src="./images/mail.png">
            <p>As you can see, the main focus of the mail is the <span>call to action</span>. The picture shows a preview of the website so people can get a <span>general idea</span> of what they will see when they click on my portfolio.</p>

            <h2>Analysing the data</h2>
            <h3>Mail data</h3>
            <p>The image below shows the <span>activity</span> the mail had.</p>
            <img src="./images/clickdata.png">
            <img src="./images/datagraph.png">
            <p>As you can see in the graphs and data provided in the images above, there has been a total of <span>49 clicks</span>,  with <span>20</span> of those being <span>unique users</span>.</p>
            <h3>Survey data</h3>
            <p>The survey was answered by a total of <span>15 unique users</span>. The results are displayed in the images below.</p>
            <img src="./images/surveydata.png">
            <img src="./images/surveydata2.png">
            <p>By analyzing the data that is provided, we can see that the <span>average score for design is 8.1</span>, while the average score given to <span>content was 7.6</span>. This falls in line with the other questoin 'What is the weakest link of my portfolio?' in which <span>60% of the answers were 'Content'</span>.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Feedback is very valueable to everyone, but especially junior developers. Therefore Mailchimp provides a great service in helping with that. In this exercise i was able to learn the weak points of my portfolio, which i can now improve.</p>
